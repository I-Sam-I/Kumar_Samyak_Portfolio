                        Over the last couple of weeks, I have been focused on preparing for the ISM Showcase this Thursday (29th), where all ISM students from the district present their research and original work. One thing I am proud of from these weeks is my utilization of Canva’s feature to create custom-sized designs. So, I used the real-world size of the trifold (48x36 in) in Canva and added a couple of lines 12 inches from the edges of the design to represent the trifold. This way, I could accurately design the board with proper scaling when I went to print it out. Furthermore, since it was real-world scaling on Canva, I could easily replicate the design in real life by just copying down the placements. However, I will need to figure out how to power my robotic hand and charge my laptop at the event, since it will be held in the middle of a football field.
                        <br>
                        Furthermore, I met with Mr. Rahmati, my mentor last year, to discuss my original work and the future iterations I will need to work towards. After this interview, I asked the big question of mentorship. Fortunately, he said yes, noting that this year I actually had the resources to bring my project to life and that he is willing to support me through it.

                        Happy New Year! I had a very relaxing break, not working on anything. Nevertheless, since the school started, I have made progress on my robotic hand. In fact, I even 3D-printed my first iteration of the entire robotic hand, in which I could place all my servos and actually have the hand work, since I had all the electronics and basic code done. Unfortunately, this 100g print is useless because the 3D model I had downloaded last (academic) year in ISM 1 for my servo was incorrect compared to the one I physically bought. This waste of 100g can be attributed to one singular letter. I downloaded a model of the “SG90S” servo, but I bought the better “MG90S”, which is only a couple of millimeters longer. Moreover, the model underrepresented the width of the wires exiting the servo, resulting in the holes for the wires being too small by just a couple of millimeters. There is a learning moment from this failed print, however, as I realized that there is nothing holding the servo down in the palm. So, my next iteration will use the correct servo model and include a mechanism to firmly keep the servo in place.

                        Over the past few weeks and during Thanksgiving break, I have interviewed multiple professionals who all affirmed my designs and plans and advised me to get on my feet and start actually printing and wiring to iterate on my designs meaningfully. My progress so far has been to refine my designs based on my interviews, 3D print them, buy the electrical components, and begin basic prototyping. I have been experimenting with the servos and Pico with some code. Specifically, I am learning the low-level workings of the servos and the Pico through the PCA9685. Once I understand how these work, I can move on to using the servos for their intended purpose: curling a finger. I plan to iterate on the spool's design until it consistently pulls the tendon back to curl the finger fully. Then I will move on to repeating this for all five fingers and to get the first prototype of the entire robotic hand.
                        <br>
                        As for mentorship, I yet again have two strong candidates: my previous mentor and a student at TAMU pursuing a master's in robotics. The conversations with each of them have been super beneficial, with their own benefits. I think I will keep talking to them and slowly introduce the idea of mentorship by mentioning bi-weekly calls or something, and see if they have any problems due to their schedules.

                        Over these past couple of weeks, I have been thinking more about CADing and building my robotic hand because I need to plan out where to place my servos. As per my previous plans, I am currently working on embedding the motors into the palm of the hand and positioning them such that all five do not interfere with one another. Alongside this, I am designing a spool to attach to the horns of the servo, rather than its pinion. But the horn’s length causes my spool to be bigger than my palm height. The obvious course of action is to simply increase the height of the palm to accommodate the spool. However, doing so would make it look bulky in my opinion. So, instead, I plan on keeping the same height but having cutouts in the backside of the hand in which the spool can stick out. These extrusions can be covered with the Raspberry Pi and power supply mounts on top, maintaining their aesthetic appeal. Nevertheless, all this planning won’t matter if I can not physically get all five servos to fit in the palm. If this is the case, I will just move it externally and not worry about the size of the spools.
                        <br>
                        My plans for the next few weeks are to acquire some jumper wires and either purchase a new Raspberry Pi Pico or keep my 3 B+ Pi to test out my designs and complete a prototype by the end of the year. I plan to have at least one finger actuated by a servo using tendons for my original work. Obviously, an entire hand would be preferable.
                        <br>
                        As for interviews, I have two more scheduled for this week: one with my mentor from last year and another with a college student at TAMU who is studying robotics for his master's degree. Hopefully, these go well and provide even more insights into my development.

                        I have been reaching out to professionals, mostly college professors and students in robotics-related classes and labs. Out of the numerous cold emails I sent, I received only two replies. One of which was simply a denial, and suggested I ask other professors. The second one, however, agreed to a short conversation. The conversation was productive as we discussed his work in robotics at UT Austin and gained some vital insights into my own project, a 3D printable tendon-driven robotic hand. He recommended that I not worry too much about embedding the servos into the palm of the hand, and could simply mount them onto an external part, such as a forearm. Taking this into consideration, I have decided to try to embed the servos until the end of the month, and only if this proves unsuccessful will I mount the servos externally. Ultimately, I hope to get the robotic hand working for my original work so I can move on to (maybe) developing a robotic arm for the hand or make it more dexterous, especially if the servos are external.
                        <br>
                        For my third interview, I plan to reconnect with my mentor from last year, showcase my progress, and ask for his insights into the electrical aspects of my project, specifically regarding the controller and power supply. Lastly, I plan to ask Professor Justin Hart (the interview mentioned above) for another interview in a couple of weeks to showcase my progress.

                        The past couple of weeks have been busy for me with all my tests, college applications, and ISM. Now, I have shifted my focus from research papers to interviewing professionals in the field. Although I already have warm contacts from last year, I want to reach out to new people and connect with professionals. So, so far, I have created a list of professionals and companies that are oriented around robotics. I will use this list of contacts to conduct cold emails or cold calls this week and hopefully secure an interview with at least one of them. In doing so, I will deviate from my usual connections and step outside my comfort zone. Furthermore, I plan to interview my PLTW Digital Electronics teacher because her class is precisely what my electronics course will be based on.

                        On the other hand, my work with the robotic hand has hit a roadblock as I encounter a couple of obstacles. Firstly, I need to figure out a way to attach a spool to the servos; this is a problem because the pinion on the servo has tiny gear teeth that are too small for my 3D printer. Secondly, I also need to plan out my electronics and design the layout to mount them onto the robotic hand.

                        Going into the ISM Professional Symposium for the second time, I already knew what to expect, so I prepared myself for the onslaught of polite small conversations with enthusiastic professionals from a variety of fields and students with the same drive and passion as I. I really enjoyed seeing the massive number of students in ISM this year. It did backfire a bit since there weren’t quite enough professionals for every group of students. Nevertheless, it all worked out, and I got to meet people both related and unrelated to my career field of robotics. I received advice on my future based on potential colleges and jobs. Surprisingly, most professionals said that, in the long run, a college degree is not as significant as I had believed it to be. Many ended up in a fulfilling job that was not related to their college education. Then came the mock interviews. This year, I made it my goal to sit down with anyone, regardless of their career. This mindset proved invaluable as I sat down with a retired teacher and an editor who also helps students with their college applications. So, I received a lot of impactful and personalized advice based on me and my interests. All in all, the symposium was amazing and equally as beneficial as always, and I wish it continues striving for the same level of quality for the upcoming students.

                        This past week, I have been preparing for my second Professional Symposium. Firstly, I have been thinking about the answers to the typical questions that will be asked of me during interviews and networking with professionals and students. Do not get me wrong, I have not been memorizing scripted answers; instead, I am thinking about bullet points that I should talk about, given any questions. For example, suppose someone asks me about my ISM topic/project. In that case, I am not going to go into depth about robotics and AI; instead, I will keep it simple and talk about how I am researching and developing a robotic hand that can grasp objects on its own using computer vision. I could then expand on it by talking about why I chose this: scalability. I can continue this project by developing a robotic arm for the hand and then improving the computer vision system. Secondly, I have refreshed my resume to make it more concise while holding all my new experiences with the help of my teacher and classmates. Finally, other than preparing for the symposium, I have also begun my research with an excellent article that has similar functionality and design to mine. One obstacle I am facing, however, is that this article references another that discusses how they designed a two-DOF thumb using just one motor, which would be a game-changer for me. Unfortunately, it is blocked behind a paywall and requires me to ask for access directly from the authors, which is unlikely.

                        Having begun my second year in ISM, have learned a few tricks here and there to conduct my research more efficiently and productively. For example, I utilize the databases that my school and district provide completely free of charge, which contain every topic that anyone would need for their research. Furthermore, Gale databases allow users to explore their topic via a topic finder wheel/tile. This tool has enabled me to expand my prompting beyond rudimentary searches of “robotic hands” or “computer vision.” Instead, I input a broad category into the topic finder, like “automating robotics with computer vision” or “3D printing for robotics.” Then, the topic finder would provide numerous sub-topics under this and several articles/papers that fall under those categories. By using this, I have managed to save countless research papers related to 3D printing for robotics, approximately twenty. Imagine the number of highly credible sources I can get for all the other research areas, like computer vision, electronics, and even something as simple as inverse kinematics. Other than just research, I have also begun preparing for the ISM Symposium by refining my resume and preparing not only to answer questions, but also to ask questions to professionals in any field, even if they share no connection to robotics. I look forward to revitalizing my ISM journey and also to inspiring other students to reach for the stars.

                        Firstly, I returned to the Independent Study and Mentorship (ISM) program for a second time to continue developing my professionalism, research skills, and dedication to my project. ISM allowed me to explore robotics engineering and solidified my passion for pursuing it as a career. I concluded the year with a 3D design of a tendon-driver robotic hand. However, my lack of hands-on 3D printing left the design with significant flaws. While I had researched 3D printing, I had never actually designed and printed a functioning model. Over the summer, after touring some exceptional colleges and even staying at one for a week, I gained unrestricted access to a Bambu Lab P1S (without AMS). This allowed me to understand better what mechanical systems could realistically be 3D printed. Using this experience, I completely restructured my robotic fingers and hand, and continued iterating based on prior and new research. I will delve deeper into the exact changes in future blogs, but for now, just know that I successfully 3D printed a robotic hand, albeit without motors or any controlling system. My next step is to dive deeper into the electrical aspects of robotics, specifically the servos, Raspberry Pis, and circuit design. I'm focusing on using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that I had lying around for the central controller for the hand. This phase will bridge my mechanical progress with the electronics necessary to make the hand fully functional. The next phase after this would be to integrate these components and then program them.                    </div>
